# multipleBB_droughts

## Proposed analyses and datasets
This project is designed to explore simultaneous breadbasket droughts across crop producing regions of the Southern Hemisphere for wheat, maize, and soybeans. We will explore both droughts across countries within a crop and across crops.

## Analyses
 - To what extent does ENSO control the likelihood of multiple breadbasket failures?
	- How strongly does it do so in joint probability distributions, and what does that say about whether regions are connected by single mechanisms or by collections of influences?
		- For example, if ENSO sometimes affects X, which affects A and B country, those would likely co-occur in the conditional probability of A fails given B fails much more frequently than if ENSO sometimes affects X which affects A and sometimes affects Y which affects B. Basically, does ENSO impose correlated risks by uniformly increasing risks with single mechanisms?

### Data


## Methods
### Crop yield growing seasons
Below I outline the crop yield growing seasons for each country and crop with the corresponding GEOGLAM crop calendar listed alongside it. Above each set of countries is a suggested three season climate season to use across all countries with an optional fourth season in brackets
